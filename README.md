# ALVNS
Autonomous Land Vehicle Navigation System. Neil Nie & Michael Meng, 2017 

## Introduction
We wanted to build a self driving car. We didn't build an actual car, but we built a golf cart, and wrote a system that can work on a real car as well. 

This project has several different modules. 

1. Autonomous steering 
2. Vehicle 🚗 & object detection 
3. Traffic light 🚦 recognition
4. Road segmentation 🛣️
5. Lane detection
6. Engineering

## Autonomous steering
The technique for steering the vechicle has several submodules.
