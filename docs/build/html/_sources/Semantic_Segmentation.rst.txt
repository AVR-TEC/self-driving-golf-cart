Welcome! This is an open source self-driving development platform aimed for rapid prototyping, deep learning and robotics research. The system currently runs on a modified electric golf cart, but the code could work on a real car as well. Here are our goals:

Goals:

- Research and develop a deep learning-driven self-driving car.

- The vehicle should be able to navigate from point A to point B autonomously within a geofenced area.
