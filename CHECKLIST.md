# Phase 2.2 (ROS Integration)

## Todos (2.2.1):

### Steering
1. Transfer current system to ROS
	- ~~Write a ROS steering node (publisher)~~
	- ~~Update the Arduino program to ROS~~
	- Test out the new steering system
	- Test on the road 
2. Visualization with rviz
	- implement visualization with rvis --> MVP: camera feed & steering angle
3. Multi-camera system improvement
	
### Data Collection
1. ~~Write the data collector node~~
2. ~~Write the ROS Arduino program~~
3. ~~Test the functionalities~~
4. Collection some data

### Sensors
1. Integrate GPS to ROS
2. Maybe add rotary encoder to the rear wheel of the vehicle.

### Others
1. Write a driver node that acts like a master launcher
2. Write shell scripts to call the driver node
3. UI stuff...
